# TWAP-Bybit

Seems like I need to use this method:
https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/market/tickers

Use v5/market/tickers and get the ask1Price and Bid1Price and get their middle
Make an order for this price
Make order with this:
https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/order/create-order
I need limit order
